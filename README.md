Hi this is a webiste displaying the images uploaded by NASA everyday i am using the nasa api the key of ehich we get by registering at their webiste.
I have added errors for diffrent possible conditions that might happen during fetching data from the api.
Added a previous and next buton to move forward and backward to look at previous image .
The next button Display property is set to none if the date is of today as no image is uploaded yet for the day after today .
I have added a loading gif for the time the image takes to be shown at the page.
Thank you this is all  .
